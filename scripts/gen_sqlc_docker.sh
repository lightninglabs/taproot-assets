# SQLite doesn't support "BIGINT PRIMARY KEY" for auto-incrementing primary
# keys, only "INTEGER PRIMARY KEY". Internally it uses 64-bit integers for
# numbers anyway, independent of the column type. So we can just use
# "INTEGER PRIMARY KEY" and it will work the same under the hood, giving us
# auto incrementing 64-bit integers.
# _BUT_, sqlc will generate Go code with int32 if we use "INTEGER PRIMARY KEY",
# even though we want int64. So before we run sqlc, we need to patch the
# source schema SQL files to use "BIGINT PRIMARY KEY" instead of "INTEGER
# PRIMARY KEY".
