// InPlaceAllocationSort performs an in-place sort of output allocations.
//
// The sort applied is a modified BIP69 sort, that uses the CLTV values of HTLCs
// as a tiebreaker in case two HTLC outputs have an identical amount and
// pkScript. The pkScripts can be the same if they share the same payment hash,
// but since the CLTV is enforced via the nLockTime of the second-layer
// transactions, the script does not directly commit to them. Instead, the CLTVs
// must be supplied separately to act as a tie-breaker, otherwise we may produce
// invalid HTLC signatures if the receiver produces an alternative ordering
// during verification. Because multiple shards of the same MPP payment can be
// identical in all other fields, we also use the HtlcIndex as a final
// tie-breaker.
//
// NOTE: Commitment and commitment anchor outputs should have a 0 CLTV and
// HtlcIndex value.
