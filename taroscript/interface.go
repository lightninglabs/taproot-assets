// asset script keys. This was derived via: sum(map(lambda y: ord(y), 'taro')).
// In order words: take the word taro and return the integer representation of
// each character and sum those. We get 438, then divide that by 2, to allow
// use to fit this into just a 2-byte integer and to ensure compatibility with
// the remote signer.
